Our main project focuses on utilizing Machine Learning (ML) for disease detection and its integration into healthcare systems to establish a proactive healthcare approach. It comprises three main components:

A multiple disease detection system -( Heart Disease, Brain Tumor, Breast Cancer, Chronic Kidney Disease)

A chatbot for medical assistance,
 
An efficient doctor-patient appointment system.

Broad Disease Coverage: Many apps use Machine Learning to predict health issues, but they focus on one disease, like heart problems or cancer. Our system predicts a wider range of diseases, providing more comprehensive healthcare support.

Accuracy and Efficiency: Compared to the current system, our proposed approach exhibits amazing accuracy and faster convergence by providing more test data.

Real-time Medical Assistance: Differing from current systems that only predicts diseases but, also offers day-to-day medical guidance and concerns.

Streamlined Appointment System: Our efficient appointment system minimizes wait times, improving the scheduling process for patients with a live face to face interaction with the doctor. Also after predicting the diseases , they are routed to a schedule with the doctor if needed.
